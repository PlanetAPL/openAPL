•av
Atomic Vector.  A 256 literal vector containing all the 8 bit
characters from 0 to 255.  •av cannot be reassigned another 
value by the user.  Warning: the first 32 of these represent
control codes and printing these may have strange effects on your
terminal.  On the Linux console, about the worst that happens is
that the code corresponding to ^G creates a beep.  However, rxvt
gets glitched by it!  Try the following for cosmetic effect:
