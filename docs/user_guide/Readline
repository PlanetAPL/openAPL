In order for readline to work, you need to have a ~/.inputrc 
file that contains the following:

	$if openapl
	set editing-mode emacs
	set convert-meta off
	set input-meta on
	set output-meta on
	$endif

(You can 'set editing-mode vi' if preferred.)

If the apl script detects an .inputrc file it will pass -r to
apl11 which will then use readline during execution.  

If your .inputrc file does not have the above but you include -r
on the command line, then the special APL characters will not work.
