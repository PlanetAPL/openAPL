Some of the files in this directory contain characters
encoded for apl2741 font (specifically the files QuadVars
and QuadFunc).

In order to see the APL characters properly, use the command
"apl -on" then view the file with an 8-bit clean pager or
editor.  Advice on 8-bit clean programs can be found in the
install_guide directory.
