SandBox Mode
-----------

SandBox Mode is an attempt to reduce the risk of damage to external files by
hostile programs.  

SandBox mode becomes active when:
1. the -s flag is provided in the argument list when apl11 is invoked.
2. Quad LX (Latent eXpression) is executed through the )load command

Situation 2. is the main reason for the existence of SandBox mode, it is
intended to be a defense against macro style viruses.  However, it should
not be regarded as total security by users who receive APL programs from
outside their control.  It does not prevent a user run program from
doing damage after being started by a legitimate method, ie 'Trojan Horse'
attack.  Furthermore, damage within the user's workspace should not be 
dismissed as trivial (which SandBox mode does not guard against).  

By design, SandBox mode cannot be tested or set within a session.  This is 
intended to prevent a hostile program from adjusting its behaviour:
once a prohibited operation is attempted during SandBox mode, control is
returned to the user.

OpenAPL could be set up by the administrator to run in SandBox mode by
putting -s on the argument list in /etc/apl.sh.  This would be easy to
bypass.  Slightly more confidence could be had by editing apl.c, to
set sandboxflg to 1 and recompiling.  

Nobody can guarantee that openAPL or APL/11 is, or can be made, secure.
