It is assumed that you have installed one of the print filters
according to the directions at: 
...openAPL/docs/install_guide/Printer

PRINTING AN APL FUNCTION
------------------------
This example shows how to print an APL function starting from 
within an APL session:

	)fns
your_function	other	functions
	)write your_function
	)shell
$ ls
file1       file2      your_function
$ apl2gs your_function | lpr
$ exit
        )lib
file1      file2       your_function
	)drop your_function
	)lib
file1      file2


PRINTING THE OUTPUT FROM OPENAPL
--------------------------------
This example shows how to capture an APL session for subsequent
editing and print.  Unfortunately, it is necessary to bypass the
convenience of the "apl" wrapper file in order to take advantage
of the Unix script(1) utility.

$ apl -on 
Loading /usr/share/keytables/apl2741.map
$ script tempfile
Script started, output file is tempfile
$ apl11
openAPL Version x.y
clear ws
        3 3ыв9
1 2 3
4 5 6
7 8 9
	)off
$ exit
exit
Script done, output file is tempfile
$ ls
file1       file2      tempfile
$ apl2gs tempfile | lpr

If you needed to capture the results from an APL session already
running, use )continue to suspend the session.   Invoke the script
utility as above.  When apl11 is restarted, it will resume its
workspace from where you left off.  Remember to delete the files
"continue" and "tempfile" after the session has ended.
