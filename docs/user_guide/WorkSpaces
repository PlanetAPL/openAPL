workspace is the same as the file name.  

A saved workspace includes function definitions and 
variables.  If there are suspended functions, all of the 
local variables for those functions are also saved.  
However, the APL state indicator is not saved, so that those
variables become global in scope when the saved workspace is
loaded.  Trying to save the state indicator is very hard in 
the current version of the interpreter because of the way 
the main program loop is implemented.

The first time you run apl, a directory named "apl" will
be created in your $HOME directory, this contains the
workspace "continue" which is in turn automatically loaded
on startup - it displays the copyright message.  Delete the
file "continue" when you have had enough of it; however, 
the "apl" directory in your $HOME directory should remain as
a place to keep openAPL workspaces.
