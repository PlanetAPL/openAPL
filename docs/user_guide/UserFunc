          
APL\11 does not include a built-in editing capability.  All 
functions are edited by dumping the source code into a 
temporary file and then invoking the user's editor of choice 
on that temporary file.  The temporary file is created in 
/tmp.  

To edit a function, type the del character followed by the
function name.  If the function name does not exist, a 
blank file will be created.

The header line of a function must begin with a del symbol.
The last line of a function may consist of a del symbol on 
its own - its optional.

The new function definition is read back in when the editing
process terminates.  Any errors in the function header will
be detected and the function will not be permitted to execute.
The body of the function is not compiled into byte codes until
the function is called, hence syntax errors in the source will
not be detected until then.

If during function editing, you change the function's name,
then upon reading the file back in, a new function will appear
in the workspace.  The old function will be intact.
          
APL will not allow the user to edit suspended functions.  If
the user attempts to do so, APL responds with the message 
"si damage -- type ')reset'".  There isn't any actual damage
to the state indicator, although the message might be 
interpreted that way.  

Which editor is invoked is determined by the value of
the shell variable EDITOR.  If EDITOR is not defined, apl
will refuse to edit your functions! The editor must be a
TEXT editor (repagination or special control characters are
not tolerated) and it must be 8 bit clean (so that it may
display the APL special characters correctly).  The EDITOR
variable may be changed by:
- editing the file .aplrc in the users' home directory
- editing the file apl.sh in the system configuration directory
  (usually /etc), or
- through the user set-up wizard which can be invoked by the 
  command:
  
	$> apl -s
