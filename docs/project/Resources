FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS ON APL
---------------------------------
The FAQ for APL has this to say about the waterloo site from 
which most of the material for openAPL was sourced:

"archive.uwaterloo.ca or watserv1.waterloo.edu
 (watserv1.uwaterloo.ca), L.J. Dickey's collection. Current J
   distribution for many machines (and J source, including
   LinkJ), APL\11, CAPL, IAPL, TryAPL, RatAPL, APL fonts, TeX
   macros and fonts, the Toronto toolkit, some other WS, archives
   of comp.lang.apl, the APL standard, an Introduction to J, and
   this FAQ. These are in directories starting from directory
   languages/apl "

   (Note that the quoted reference to "this FAQ" is not to this
   document, rather to a FAQ at the above location).

The URL for the FAQ is:

  ftp://archive.uwaterloo.ca/ftparch/languages/apl/faq

UPDATES TO OPENAPL
------------------
If and when incremental releases to openAPL are published, they
will be made available at: 

    ftp://sunsite.unc.edu/pub/Linux/Incoming/openAPL-x.y.tgz
or  ftp://sunsite.unc.edu/pub/Linux/devel/lang/apl/openAPL-x.y.tgz
where x.y are version and revision numbers.

REFERENCE MANUAL
----------------
OpenAPL comes with no language manual. You may be able to use
a copy of the latest standard for this role providing that you
are prepared to disregard any references to features not present 
in openAPL (it is after all a standard for an extended APL). 
Also, be warned that it is a Postscript document that will require
the best part of a ream of paper to print.  The URL for "Programming
Language APL, Extended..." is:

 ftp://archive.uwaterloo.ca
      /ftparch/languages/apl/standards/dis/apldis.ps.gz

FONTPRINT
---------
Files containing 8bit encoded openAPL characters may be printed on
an Epson(TM) or compatible printer (or converted into a GIF file) 
using the fontprint package which is not specifically targeted at
APL.  The URL for fontprint is:

  ftp://sunsite.unc.edu/pub/Linux/utils/text/fprint-3.0.2.tar.gz
