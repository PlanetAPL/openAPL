The X11 font was obtained from watserv1.waterloo.edu where it 
was packaged as xfontapl.tar and included the dedication:

     The font in this directory was supplied by Robert Metzger.

aplox.*.bdf
-----------
This group of X11 fonts was created by Sam Sirlin by scaling up
apl8x13.bdf.

apl8x16.psf
-----------
The Linux console font was derived from the file aply16.psf in 
the kbd package.  One of the readme files from that package
attributes the original to Raul D. Miller.


APL\11
------
APL\11 has a relatively long history.  The original program 
was written by Ken Thompson at Bell Laboratories, apparently
in the days before Version 6 UNIX.  

It spent some time at Yale and finally arrived at Purdue University.  

Since 1976 it has been modified by Jim Besemer and John Bruner, 
graduate students at Purdue.  Based on the comments in the code, 
John did a lot of work on making the interpreter more robust. 

Anthony Reeves, then of the EE faculty at Purdue, whose name appears 
on much of the documentation, provided direction. 
          
Mike Cain got a copy of the Purdue version from John while working 
at Bell Labs, then carried it to Bellcore and U S WEST.  Mike cleaned
it up, fixed several errors, wrote some new documentation, formatted
a lot of the old Purdue documentation, and added some additional 
functionality.  

Marty Glopta at Bell Labs did a lot of the initial leg work 
involved in getting approval to distribute the source.  

It was put into the FTP archive at watserv1.waterloo.edu in the
early 1990's.  While there, several new versions appeared which
used different ASCII to APL character transliterations: these 
included works by William Chang and Sam Sirlin. 

In 1996, Branko Bratkovic recognised that the Linux console was
an ideal means of generating APL character fonts on PC based
equipment.  Branko selected the font apl2741 as the basis for
an 8bit character encoding scheme and created screen font and
keyboard files to support it.  The IO routines of APL\11 were
then modified to accept 8bit encoded characters.  Branko then
made further modifications to the body of APL\11 to make it
more open.

openAPL was released to the public in November 1998 for Alpha
testing. During the Alpha trial, the following contributions
were made:
- a set of larger fonts by Sam Sirlin;
- a replacement for ecvt() by Sam Sirlin; 
- RedHat section for the Makefile by Robert Brown;
- RH5.2 Makfile addition, ghost script filter patch, memory
  leak fix by Gerald Jansen;
- readline proof of concept by Gerald Jansen
- Guy Larocque provided font files for LinuxPPC (Macintosh), 
  plus assistance debugging that platform.
- Tauno Ylinen provided numerous improvements that had been
  developed for FreeAPL (Windows) including:
  - special case of dyadic rho
  - special case of dyadic equal and not-equal
  - quad EX (expunge)
  - quad AI
