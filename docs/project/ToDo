To Do List, version 0.0
-----------------------
This list describes what I intend to get done during the ALPHA testing
period.  The overall goal is to create a useable APL for GNU/Linux -
diversions for enhancements will be resisted.  The list is in
approximate priority order (highest first), however, it could change
in response to something that the ALPHA testers may discover.

Rewrite the Quality Assurance (QA) scripts to cover as much APL
