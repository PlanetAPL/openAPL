FILE PAGERS KNOWN TO WORK WITH APL2741 ENCODING
-----------------------------------------------
One would not normally want to page APL files under an 
openAPL session.  However, functions can be written out
to unix files; some of the documentation and all of the QA
test files are encoded in APL2741 so the use of a pager
can be convient at times. Note: in order to to use a pager
to view APL2741 encoding, you should be running a shell
inside an emulated APL terminal, ie following the command:

	$> apl -on

more
----
The classic Unix pager "more" does not attempt to change the
8th bit which is used to represent APL characters.  That is, 
it displays raw characters and so is suitable for viewing
APL2741 encoded files.
Tested on version 5.19 (Berkeley) 6/29/88 on a Debian system.

less 
----
The more clone "less" can be made to display raw characters
with the option -r.  Ease of use can be improved by setting
the environment variable LESS to include this option.
Tested on version 332
