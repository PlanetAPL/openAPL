FUNCTION EDITOR FOR OPENAPL
---------------------------
APL\11 does not have a built-in editor.  Instead, whenever 
editing is required, it writes the function out to a temporary
file and invokes an external editor on it. 

Set-up Wizard
-------------
The user set-up wizard may be invoked with the command:

	$> apl -setup

The wizard will attempt to select default editors for you based 
on those that are known to be 8 bit clean and present on your 
distribution.  The setup wizard will also add the string 
"-fn $x11font" to the $x11editor variable so it will use the 
same font as your terminal emulation.  

Manual Selection
----------------
Should you want to use an editor of your choice, edit the
following lines in the file .aplrc in your home directory: 

	editor="<an_alternative_editor>"
and/or	x11editor="<an_alternative_editor>"

where <an_alternative_editor> includes any additional flags that 
may be required to get it to work with 8 bit characters. 

Testing
-------
Testing is similar to that for terminals: use the editor to 
examine the file "000-255.txt", then attempt to type the ALT (or
mode switch key) characters on each row of the keyboard.
