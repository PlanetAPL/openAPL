Two print methods are available, they are both optioned out by
default and need to be turned on by editing the file configure
in the top level openAPL directory BEFORE running ./configure 
and "make install".


PRINTING APL TEXT ON A GHOSTSCRIPT PRINTER
------------------------------------------
The shell script "apl2gs" provides a means of printing APL2741
encoded text on a Postscript(TM) printer.  Apl2gs may be used 
in the same way as a2gs(1).  Indeed, apl2gs uses a2gs and the 
command line options given to apl2gs are simply passed to a2gs 
for reuse. 

The postscript font file "apl2741.fnt" must be installed somewhere
on your machine.  Normally the Makefile will take care of this, 
however if you store it elsewhere, edit apl2gs or /etc/apl.sh to
point "$gsfont" at the actual location. 


PRINTING APL TEXT ON AN EPSON PRINTER
-------------------------------------
The shell script "apl2epson" provides a means of printing APL2741
encoded text on an Epson(TM) printer (or clone).  It uses fontprint
which is dependent on the Linux console font "apl8x16.psf".  If
fontprint isn't part of your distribution download a copy from
sunsite and compile it (look for fprint).

If you intend to use an Epson printer with openAPL on a non Linux
system, it will be necessary to store the psf font file somewhere
on your machine.  In most cases autoconf/configure and the Makefile
will take care of this.  However, if it breaks and you need to fix
it after installation, check that $consolefontdir in apl, and 
apl2epson are in agreement with the location of "apl8x16.psf".

POSTINSTALLATION
---------------
The Postscript(TM) font file apl2741.fnt contains a bug that
(due to copyright reasons) cannot be corrected and redistributed.
It affects the percent symbol and instructions for fixing it
locally can be found in the BugList file.
