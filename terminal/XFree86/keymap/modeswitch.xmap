! A file to use with xmodmap to convert the right ALT key
! into the "Mode Switch" key.  
! There are other ways to obtain a Mode Switch key on your
! X11 keyboard, eg through the XF86Config file or XKB, if 
! you use one of these, then loading this file is not 
! necessary.

keycode 113 = Mode_switch
clear Mod3
add Mod3 = Mode_switch
