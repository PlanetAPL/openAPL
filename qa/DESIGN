QUALITY ASSURANCE PROCEDURE
---------------------------

The QA directory contains a number of tests that can be run
individually or batched through the Makefile.  Several uses
for these files are:

-  As new versions of apl\11 are prepared for release, the 
   Makefile supported test run should be conducted (simply
   with the command 'make').  If there are no problems, the
   process will finish silently.  If the behaviour of the
   latest version of apl11 is different, make will be 
   aborted at the first discrepancy that it finds.

-  For testing isolated aspects of apl11, it is possible to
   run make with an additional argument that specifies just
   one test.

-  Before major hacking is attempted on a source file, a 
   baseline test file should be written and used to produce
   a reference file *.ref, see below.  After the change is
   developed, the test file could be rerun and the results 
   compared to the reference.

-  Demonstration of features to someone new to APL.

These are the file types and their roles (replace "foobar"
with the name of the test case).

foobar.in	- the raw input
foobar.ref	- the result of running foobar.in at some
		  previous time and manually checking the 
		  results.
foobar.out	- a file created through Makefile that 
		  consists of the output from apl11 when 
		  given foobar.in as stdin.
foobar.dif	- the difference between foobar.out and
		  foobar.ref . This file should be empty,
		  if not, the test foobar had failed.
foobar.dat	- data files, (do not delete).


RUNNING THE TESTS THROUGH THE MAKEFILE
--------------------------------------
Generate test case foobar output
$> make foobar.out 

Validate test case foobar
$> make foobar.dif 

Create a new reference file
$> chmod +w foobar.ref
$> cp foobar.out foobar.ref
$> chmod a-w foobar.ref

Run all the tests
$> make	clean
$> make	

Remove all *.out and *.dif files
$> make clean 


USING THE FILES FROM THE KEYBOARD
---------------------------------
Start 2741 terminal emulation
$> apl -on

Examine a test run in progress
$> apl11 < foobar.in | more

Stop 2741 terminal emulation
$> apl -off
