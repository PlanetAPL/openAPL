Printer Scripts Design Notes
----------------------------
Apl2epson and apl2gs are simple shell scripts that set up some
variables, source /etc/apl.sh and ~/.aplrc, and call some real
print filters with the APL2741 font as a parameter.

It was not possible to use a2ps because it could not be made
to ignore the 8th bit.  A2gs worked in this respect, plus its
default font (Courier) is very close to the metrics of apl2741.fnt.

The original tar file from which apl2741.fnt was extracted contains
instructions for using it with other applications.  Refer to the
Credits file for directions to the archive site.
