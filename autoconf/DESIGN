Design Notes for autoconf implementation in openAPL
---------------------------------------------------

The autoconf files are in a directory of their own under the root
openAPL directory for no better reason than cosmetics, ie to keep
the top level directory clean.  In order to support this, the 
AC_INIT() and AC_OUTPUT() macros use one level up references "../"

A package supported by autoconf works like this:
- the maintainer writes 'configure.in'
- the maintainer runs autoconf which creates 'configure' from
  'configure.in'
- the maintainer writes files like 'Makefile.in'
- at this point the package is distributed
- the person compiling the code on his or her machine runs the
  'configure' in the distribution dierctory (hence the need to provide
  absolute pathname './configure'
- the 'configure' script creates files like 'Makefile' from files like
  'Makefile.in'
- usually 'make' is run with the resulting 'Makefile' to build the
  package

Note the following aspects of this implementation:
- autoconf is used to set variables in various shell scripts (not 
  _just_ the 'Makefile').  This is enabled by the AC_SUBST() macro.
- Autoconf is good at finding variables in library files, however, one
  of the major requirements in openAPL is for keeping track of
  directories that hold the various font and mapping files.  Finding
  these directories has to be done by writing the tests in shell
  script.  This is the major part of the configure.in file.
- The top level openAPL direcory contains a dummy './configure' script
  that cd's to autoconf and runs the real configure.

Here are the special variables that glue openAPL together
$prefix
$bindir
$man1dir		on line manual pages location
(the above come with autoconf, the rest had to be hand coded)

$consolefontdir		used by kbd package under Linux
$keytabledir		ditto
$defaultfont		ditto - used to get the console back to normal

$gsfontdir		a place to keep ghostscript font files

$x11lib			the root directory for various X11 support
			files, used by openAPL to keep keyboard
			mapping files

$x11fontdir		a place to keep X11 font files

$wsdir			a place to keep the APL workspace files
			such as the first time user workspace
